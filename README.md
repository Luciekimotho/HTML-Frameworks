# HTML-Frameworks

A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.
In the web design, a framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site.
Most websites share a very similar structure. Frameworks provide a common structure so that developers donâ€™t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided.
